      <h1 align="center">My Learning Experience</h1>

      <h2>What I have learnt</h2>
      <p>
        The things that I have learnt so far are:
        <!-- Start of an unordered list -->
          <ul>
            <!-- Inserting list items -->
            <li>HTML Skills</li>
            <li>Better Communication Skills</li>
            <li>Problem Solving</li>
          </ul>
          <!-- End of an unordered list -->
        To elaborate on what I have learnt so far, I have learnt how to use HTML and the way it is structured and the uses of it in different things with regards to web pages along with the correct and proper ways for it to be used. As well as the ways how to not use it and the normal mispractices with regards to how to code as well. I have also learnt how to communicate better with my peers and the lecturers , as well as how to effectively commmunicate my point better so that I am understood and not misunderstood. Importantly I have also learnt how to solve problems better and find solutions to problems that I could now initally solve. With hard work and perseverance you can solve any problem , you just need to work hard and look for the creative solution or maybe it was just infront of you already and you didnt see it.
